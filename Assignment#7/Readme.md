### Part 1 : Sequence to sequence task : Demonstrate the use of RNN, LSTM, GRU, WAVENET  for a timeseries prediction task (next 10 items)  and show  it works better than regular classification
> DL_Assignment_7_Part_1.ipynb

### Part 2: Demonstrate very simple many to one, one to many and many to many RNN colabs 
> DL_Assignment_7_Part_2.ipynb

### Part 3: Bidirectional RNN : Sequence to vector task : Demonstrate bidirectional RNN and all its features in sequential MNIST task classification colab
> DL_Assignment_7_Part_3.ipynb

### Part  4:  Practical application of RNN : Train a video action classifier using CNN-RNN combo (cnn for features and RNN for classification)
