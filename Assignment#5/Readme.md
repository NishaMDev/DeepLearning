# Part 1: 

A) Write a colab/colabs where you will use advanced Keras deep learning constructs concepts

Solution: - PART_A_Custom_Modeling.ipynb



# Part 2 : 

Do the below codelabs to exercise your ondevice ML skills

and in github provide all the artifacts and screenshots of your work (do not copy from codelab the screenshot - i would like to see it running on your computer screenshot )

**a) Mobile App and Image training on device: Build and deploy a custom object detection model using tflite on android simulator:-**

Solution: -
