        "In this tutorial, we will discuss the application of neural networks on graphs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently gained increasing popularity in both applications and research, including domains such as social networks, knowledge graphs, recommender systems, and bioinformatics. While the theory and math behind GNNs might first seem complicated, the implementation of those models is quite simple and helps in understanding the methodology. Therefore, we will discuss the implementation of basic network layers of a GNN, namely graph convolutions, and attention layers. Finally, we will apply a GNN on a node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks.\n",

        "\n",
        "Before starting the discussion of specific neural network operations on graphs, we should consider how to represent a graph. Mathematically, a graph $\\mathcal{G}$ is defined as a tuple of a set of nodes/vertices $V$, and a set of edges/links $E$: $\\mathcal{G}=(V,E)$. Each edge is a pair of two vertices, and represents a connection between them. For instance, let's look at the following graph:\n",
        "\n",
        "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding:10px\"><img src=\"example_graph.svg\" width=\"250px\"></center>\n",
        "\n",
        "The vertices are $V=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, and edges $E=\\{(1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)\\}$. Note that for simplicity, we assume the graph to be undirected and hence don't add mirrored pairs like $(2,1)$. In application, vertices and edge can often have specific attributes, and edges can even be directed. The question is how we could represent this diversity in an efficient way for matrix operations. Usually, for the edges, we decide between two variants: an adjacency matrix, or a list of paired vertex indices. \n",
        "\n",
        "The **adjacency matrix** $A$ is a square matrix whose elements indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent, i.e. connected, or not. In the simplest case, $A_{ij}$ is 1 if there is a connection from node $i$ to $j$, and otherwise 0. If we have edge attributes or different categories of edges in a graph, this information can be added to the matrix as well. For an undirected graph, keep in mind that $A$ is a symmetric matrix ($A_{ij}=A_{ji}$). For the example graph above, we have the following adjacency matrix:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
        "    0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n",
        "    1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n",
        "    0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\\\\n",
        "    0 & 1 & 1 & 0\n",
        "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "While expressing a graph as a list of edges is more efficient in terms of memory and (possibly) computation, using an adjacency matrix is more intuitive and simpler to implement. In our implementations below, we will rely on the adjacency matrix to keep the code simple. However, common libraries use edge lists, which we will discuss later more.\n",
        "Alternatively, we could also use the list of edges to define a sparse adjacency matrix with which we can work as if it was a dense matrix, but allows more memory-efficient operations. PyTorch supports this with the sub-package `torch.sparse` ([documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/sparse.html)) which is however still in a beta-stage (API might change in future)."

        "\n",
        "Graph Convolutional Networks have been introduced by [Kipf et al.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJU4ayYgl) in 2016 at the University of Amsterdam. He also wrote a great [blog post](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/) about this topic, which is recommended if you want to read about GCNs from a different perspective. GCNs are similar to convolutions in images in the sense that the \"filter\" parameters are typically shared over all locations in the graph. At the same time, GCNs rely on message passing methods, which means that vertices exchange information with the neighbors, and send \"messages\" to each other. Before looking at the math, we can try to visually understand how GCNs work. The first step is that each node creates a feature vector that represents the message it wants to send to all its neighbors. In the second step, the messages are sent to the neighbors, so that a node receives one message per adjacent node. Below we have visualized the two steps for our example graph. \n",
        "\n",
        "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding:10px\"><img src=\"graph_message_passing.svg\" width=\"700px\"></center>\n",
        "\n",
        "If we want to formulate that in more mathematical terms, we need to first decide how to combine all the messages a node receives. As the number of messages vary across nodes, we need an operation that works for any number. Hence, the usual way to go is to sum or take the mean. Given the previous features of nodes $H^{(l)}$, the GCN layer is defined as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$H^{(l+1)} = \\sigma\\left(\\hat{D}^{-1/2}\\hat{A}\\hat{D}^{-1/2}H^{(l)}W^{(l)}\\right)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$W^{(l)}$ is the weight parameters with which we transform the input features into messages ($H^{(l)}W^{(l)}$). To the adjacency matrix $A$ we add the identity matrix so that each node sends its own message also to itself: $\\hat{A}=A+I$. Finally, to take the average instead of summing, we calculate the matrix $\\hat{D}$ which is a diagonal matrix with $D_{ii}$ denoting the number of neighbors node $i$ has. $\\sigma$ represents an arbitrary activation function, and not necessarily the sigmoid (usually a ReLU-based activation function is used in GNNs). \n",
        "\n",
        "When implementing the GCN layer in PyTorch, we can take advantage of the flexible operations on tensors. Instead of defining a matrix $\\hat{D}$, we can simply divide the summed messages by the number of neighbors afterward. Additionally, we replace the weight matrix with a linear layer, which additionally allows us to add a bias. Written as a PyTorch module, the GCN layer is defined as follows:"

For a visualization, see below (figure credit - [Thomas Kipf, 2016](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/)).\n",

        "However, one issue we can see from looking at the example above is that the output features for nodes 3 and 4 are the same because they have the same adjacent nodes (including itself). Therefore, GCN layers can make the network forget node-specific information if we just take a mean over all messages. Multiple possible improvements have been proposed. While the simplest option might be using residual connections, the more common approach is to either weigh the self-connections higher or define a separate weight matrix for the self-connections. Alternatively, we can re-visit a concept from the last tutorial: attention. "

        "### Graph Attention \n",
        "\n",
        "If you remember from the last tutorial, attention describes a weighted average of multiple elements with the weights dynamically computed based on an input query and elements' keys (if you haven't read Tutorial 6 yet, it is recommended to at least go through the very first section called [What is Attention?](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial6/Transformers_and_MHAttention.html#What-is-Attention?)). This concept can be similarly applied to graphs, one of such is the Graph Attention Network (called GAT, proposed by [Velickovic et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)). Similarly to the GCN, the graph attention layer creates a message for each node using a linear layer/weight matrix. For the attention part, it uses the message from the node itself as a query, and the messages to average as both keys and values (note that this also includes the message to itself). The score function $f_{attn}$ is implemented as a one-layer MLP which maps the query and key to a single value. The MLP looks as follows (figure credit - [Velickovic et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)):\n",

        "\n",
        "$h_i$ and $h_j$ are the original features from node $i$ and $j$ respectively, and represent the messages of the layer with $\\mathbf{W}$ as weight matrix. $\\mathbf{a}$ is the weight matrix of the MLP, which has the shape $[1,2\\times d_{\\text{message}}]$, and $\\alpha_{ij}$ the final attention weight from node $i$ to $j$. The calculation can be described as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\alpha_{ij} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\text{LeakyReLU}\\left(\\mathbf{a}\\left[\\mathbf{W}h_i||\\mathbf{W}h_j\\right]\\right)\\right)}{\\sum_{k\\in\\mathcal{N}_i} \\exp\\left(\\text{LeakyReLU}\\left(\\mathbf{a}\\left[\\mathbf{W}h_i||\\mathbf{W}h_k\\right]\\right)\\right)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The operator $||$ represents the concatenation, and $\\mathcal{N}_i$ the indices of the neighbors of node $i$. Note that in contrast to usual practice, we apply a non-linearity (here LeakyReLU) before the softmax over elements.

Specifically, let's remove the non-linearity for a second, and try to simplify the expression:\n",

This is why the LeakyReLU is crucial and adds some dependency on $h_i$ to the attention. \n",

Each publication is represented by a bag-of-words vector. This means that we have a vector of 1433 elements for each publication, where a 1 at feature $i$ indicates that the $i$-th word of a pre-defined dictionary is in the article. Binary bag-of-words representations are commonly used when we need very simple encodings, and already have an intuition of what words to expect in a network. There exist much better approaches, but we will leave this to the NLP courses to discuss.\n",

Link prediction means that given a graph, we want to predict whether there will be/should be an edge between two nodes or not. For example, in a social network, this is used by Facebook and co to propose new friends to you. Again, graph level information can be crucial to perform this task. The output prediction is usually done by performing a similarity metric on the pair of node features, which should be 1 if there should be a link, and otherwise close to 0. To keep the tutorial short, we will not implement this task ourselves. Nevertheless, there are many good resources out there if you are interested in looking closer at this task.\n",

The problem is treated as a supervised link prediction problem on a homogeneous citation network with nodes representing papers (with attributes such as binary keyword indicators and categorical subject) and links corresponding to paper-paper citations. \n",

        "To address this problem, we build a model with the following architecture. First we build a two-layer GCN model that takes labeled node pairs (`citing-paper` -> `cited-paper`)  corresponding to possible citation links, and outputs a pair of node embeddings for the `citing-paper` and `cited-paper` nodes of the pair. These embeddings are then fed into a link classification layer, which first applies a binary operator to those node embeddings (e.g., concatenating them) to construct the embedding of the potential link. Thus obtained link embeddings are passed through the dense link classification layer to obtain link predictions - probability for these candidate links to actually exist in the network. The entire model is trained end-to-end by minimizing the loss function of choice (e.g., binary cross-entropy between predicted link probabilities and true link labels, with true/false citation links having labels 1/0) using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates of the model parameters, with minibatches of 'training' links fed into the model."

        "Finally, in this part of the tutorial, we will have a closer look at how to apply GNNs to the task of graph classification. The goal is to classify an entire graph instead of single nodes or edges. Therefore, we are also given a dataset of multiple graphs that we need to classify based on some structural graph properties. The most common task for graph classification is molecular property prediction, in which molecules are represented as graphs. Each atom is linked to a node, and edges in the graph are the bonds between atoms. For example, look at the figure below. \n",
        "\n",
        "<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"molecule_graph.svg\" width=\"600px\"></center>\n",
        "\n",

        "When using a data loader, we encounter a problem with batching $N$ graphs. Each graph in the batch can have a different number of nodes and edges, and hence we would require a lot of padding to obtain a single tensor. Torch geometric uses a different, more efficient approach: we can view the $N$ graphs in a batch as a single large graph with concatenated node and edge list. As there is no edge between the $N$ graphs, running GNN layers on the large graph gives us the same output as running the GNN on each graph separately. Visually, this batching strategy is visualized below (figure credit - PyTorch Geometric team, [tutorial here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I8a0DfQ3fI7Njc62__mVXUlcAleUclnb?usp=sharing#scrollTo=2owRWKcuoALo)).\n",

These indices are important for performing the final prediction. To perform a prediction over a whole graph, we usually perform a pooling operation over all nodes after running the GNN model. In this case, we will use the average pooling. Hence, we need to know which nodes should be included in which average pool. Using this pooling, we can already create our graph network below.

It should be noted that as we have been using the test set for validation as well, we might have overfitted slightly to this set. Nevertheless, the experiment shows us that GNNs can be indeed powerful to predict the properties of graphs and/or molecules."

        "In this tutorial, we have seen the application of neural networks to graph structures. We looked at how a graph can be represented (adjacency matrix or edge list), and discussed the implementation of common graph layers: GCN and GAT. The implementations showed the practical side of the layers, which is often easier than the theory. Finally, we experimented with different tasks, on node-, edge- and graph-level. Overall, we have seen that including graph information in the predictions can be crucial for achieving high performance. There are a lot of applications that benefit from GNNs, and the importance of these networks will likely increase over the next years."
